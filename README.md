## Project Overview  
During emergencies, many people turn to social media platforms such as Twitter/X for fast updates. However, not all posts are accurate, relevant, or useful for public safety. This project uses a machine learning model to automatically classify tweets as either related to a real disaster (1) or not related to a disaster (0).

The dataset used is Disaster Tweets, uploaded by Viktor S. on Kaggle.
