# Machine Learning Tweet Classification  
Classifies whether a tweet is related to a real disaster or not.

---

## Project Overview  
During emergencies, many people turn to social media platforms such as Twitter/X for fast updates. However, not all posts are accurate, relevant, or useful for public safety. This project uses a machine learning model to automatically classify tweets as either related to a real disaster (1) or not related to a disaster (0).

The dataset used is Disaster Tweets, uploaded by Viktor S. on Kaggle.

## How to Run the Project

To run the model, simply open and execute the following notebook:

**`Machine_Learning_Project_Final_Script.ipynb`**

### Steps:
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook using **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run all cells in order.

This notebook contains:
- Data loading
- Preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Comparison between CNN and transformer models
